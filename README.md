# The Unbearable Heat: A UX Analysis of the Bathroom Fan at Heritage Inn

**By Yeng, March 11, 2025**

## Introduction

During my stay at Heritage Inn, I encountered a frustrating issue with the bathroom fan system. Instead of providing proper **ventilation**, the fan, controlled by a timer, seemed to circulate **hot air**, making an already uncomfortable situation even worse. This experience made me reflect on how poorly designed environmental controls can significantly impact **User eXperience (UX)** in real-world spaces.

## The Interaction

### Step 1: Turning on the Fan
Upon entering the bathroom, I noticed a timer dial for the fan instead of a standard switch. I turned it on, expecting it to provide fresh air or at least improve airflow. Instead, after a few moments, I felt a surge of **heat**, making the room increasingly uncomfortable.

> **Usability Concept: Affordance** – A well-designed system should indicate its intended function clearly. A fan should provide ventilation, not heat, so its behavior contradicted user expectations.

### Step 2: Dealing with the Heat
As I continued using the bathroom, the heat became unbearable. There was **no window or alternative ventilation**, which meant I was stuck sweating in a confined space. I tried adjusting the timer, but it only controlled how long the fan ran, not its function.

> **Usability Concept: Feedback** – Systems should communicate what they are doing. There was no clear indication that the fan was not actually ventilating air. A user should not have to guess whether turning it on will improve their experience or make it worse.

### Step 3: Ending the Suffering
Eventually, I gave up and turned the fan off, choosing to endure a stagnant but at least non-heating environment. This completely defeated the purpose of the fan, making it a **frustrating and ineffective** experience.

> **Usability Concept: Efficiency** – A good design should help users achieve their goals with minimal effort. In this case, the system forced unnecessary discomfort and problem-solving just to avoid making the situation worse.

## Suggested Improvements

1. **Replace the current system with an exhaust fan** that actually removes stale air instead of recirculating heat.
2. **Install a manual ventilation option**, such as a window or a vent that can be controlled separately from the fan.
3. **Provide clear labels** near the fan timer explaining its function (e.g., "Heat circulation only" if it doesn’t actually ventilate air).
4. **Redesign the fan controls** to allow users to choose between heat and cooling functions rather than forcing a single, uncomfortable mode.
5. **Introduce motion or humidity sensors** to automatically adjust airflow when needed instead of relying on a timer.

## Conclusion

This experience highlights how small design flaws can create major discomfort in everyday interactions with technology. A simple expectation—having a fan cool and ventilate a bathroom—was completely undermined by poor design choices. By improving usability and giving users **control over their environment**, Heritage Inn could significantly enhance their guests' **User eXperience** and comfort.
